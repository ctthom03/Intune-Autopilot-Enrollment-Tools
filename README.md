# Intune-Autopilot-Enrollment-Tools
Scripts and other tools I used to help with adding multiple devices to Intune Autopilot easier. 

Intructions to export the hash from multiple Windows devices for Windows Autopilot Enrollment:

1.	Preparation: 
o	Load the .ps1 file onto a USB thumb drive. 
o	Create a folder named "Hash Files" on the thumb drive. 
2.	Initial Setup: 
o	Connect the Windows 11 laptop to the internet during the Out-Of-Box Experience (OOBE).
o	Once connected to Wi-Fi, do not click the Next button. 
3.	Running the Script: 
o	Insert the USB thumb drive with the script file and the "Hash Files" folder. o 	Press Shift+F10 to open Command Prompt. 
o	Press Win+R, type "PowerShell ISE", and press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to open PowerShell ISE with administrative privileges. 
o	In the PowerShell ISE window, type Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted and press Enter. â–ª 	If a confirmation dialog appears, click "Yes". 
4.	Executing the PowerShell Script: 
o	Click File > Open and navigate to the .ps1 file on the thumb drive. 
o	Click the Play button (or press F5) to run the script. 
o	Respond to multiple prompts by selecting "Yes to All" where available, otherwise click "Yes". 
5.	Verification: 
o	Upon completion, a prompt will indicate the successful export of the hash, ending with the Serial Number. 
o	To verify, press Win+E to open File Explorer, navigate to the "Hash Files" folder on the flash drive, and confirm the presence of MyComputerHash.csv. 
o	Open the .csv file in Excel and verify that the serial number in the first row matches the exported hash. 
6.	Repeating the Process (if applicable): 
o	For additional laptops, remove the thumb drive and repeat steps 2 through 5. 
7.	Importing to Intune: 
o	Sign in to Intune. 
o	Follow the steps to import a device, selecting MyComputerHash.csv from the thumb drive. 
o	Ensure the number of columns matches the number of devices added to the file and that there are no incorrect columns. 
o	If everything matches, press Enter to import all devices listed in the file.
